        A portfolio refers to a collection of investments, assets, or projects held by an individual or organization. The purpose of a portfolio is typically to diversify risk and optimize returns by spreading investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Portfolios can also include non-financial assets such as artwork or collectibles.
